    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-to-image models have evolved into sophisticated engines of template culture (Grund and Scherffig), systems trained to reproduce standardized aesthetics. Fatigued by the constant flood of polished results and the arms race for images benchmarked on visual coherence, commercial value and consumer-friendliness, this workshop explores once again the charm of AI weirdness (Shane) - the failure in generative AI and the epistemic value of productive damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing inspiration from glitch studies (Menkman), we embrace glitches and artifacts as revelatory moments. Through gently violating the consumer-friendly, polished norms meant to please, we surface the model's implicit assumptions about how things are supposed to look. Participants will work directly with Diffusion Transformers (DiT), focusing on the role of **embeddings** in image-text correlation from embedding space to latent space back into pixel space. Through hands-on meddling with the pipeline, we'll systematically **damage** and **reconfigure** the **semantic substrate** that guides image generation, deliberately perturbing inputs to understand this system's sensitivity and dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This counterfactual, gently adversarial approach, positions productive damage as a research method. Through **iatrogenic techniques** performed on text-to-image models, we probe the layers of technological inscription (Latour) embedded in these systems. Values, design choices, and visual norms inscribed become legible where the system breaks down. By deliberately coaxing the model into failure, we trace the contours of what has been encoded into them.\n",
