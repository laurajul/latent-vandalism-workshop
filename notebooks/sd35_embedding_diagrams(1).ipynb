    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-to-image models have evolved into sophisticated engines of **template culture** (Grund and Scherffig), systems trained to reproduce standardized aesthetics. Fatigued by the constant flood of polished results and the arms race for images benchmarked on visual coherence, commercial value and consumer-friendliness, this workshop explores once again the charm of **AI weirdness** (Shane) - the failure in generative AI and the epistemic value of **productive damage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing inspiration from **glitch studies** (Menkman), we embrace glitches and artifacts as revelatory moments. Through gently violating the consumer-friendly, polished norms meant to please, we surface the model's implicit assumptions about how things are *supposed* to look. Participants will work directly with **Diffusion Transformers (DiT)**, focusing on the role of embeddings in image-text correlation from embedding space to latent space back into pixel space. Through hands-on meddling with the pipeline, we'll systematically damage and reconfigure the semantic substrate that guides image generation, deliberately perturbing inputs to understand this system's sensitivity and dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **counterfactual, gently adversarial approach**, positions productive damage as a research method. Through **iatrogenic techniques** performed on text-to-image models, we probe the layers of **technological inscription** (Latour) embedded in these systems. Values, design choices, and visual norms inscribed become legible where the system breaks down. By deliberately coaxing the model into failure, we trace the contours of what has been encoded into them.\n",

    "## Introduction: Workshop Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Perfect\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern text-to-image models have become exceptionally good at producing exactly what they're supposed to: coherent, aesthetically pleasing, commercially viable images. But this polish comes at a cost. These models have been trained and tuned to reproduce **template culture**—standardized visual languages that feel increasingly homogeneous.\n",
    "\n",
    "When every generated image is optimized for visual coherence and consumer appeal, we lose something valuable: the **epistemic weirdness** that reveals how these systems actually work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Productive Damage as Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop takes a different approach. Instead of trying to get the \"best\" results, we're interested in **productive damage**—deliberate interventions that make the system fail in interesting ways. By breaking things carefully, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Surface hidden assumptions** about what images \"should\" look like\n",
    "- **Reveal the training data's bias** toward certain visual patterns\n",
    "- **Understand the semantic structure** of embedding space\n",
    "- **Trace technological inscription**—the values and design choices baked into these systems\n",
    "\n",
    "As Rosa Menkman argues in glitch studies, glitches aren't just errors—they're **revelatory moments** that expose the normally invisible structures underlying digital systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach: Iatrogenic Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt what we call **iatrogenic techniques**—a term borrowed from medicine meaning \"caused by treatment itself.\" Rather than trying to optimize the pipeline, we deliberately introduce perturbations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scaling embeddings** beyond reasonable ranges\n",
    "- **Inverting semantic directions** to explore negative space\n",
    "- **Mixing incompatible concepts** that text prompts can't express\n",
    "- **Zeroing out encoders** to see what each contributes\n",
    "- **Creating impossible combinations** that violate training distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "These interventions are **gently adversarial**—we're not trying to break the system maliciously, but to understand it through carefully designed failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We're Doing Today\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we're going to peek under the hood of modern text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we'll explore how text prompts are transformed into numerical embeddings, and how those embeddings guide the image generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Insight:** Most users interact with these models through text prompts, but the models themselves don't \"see\" text. They work with **numerical embeddings**—high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. By directly manipulating these embeddings, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create images that are **impossible to generate from text alone**\n",
    "- Understand how **different text encoders** contribute distinct semantic information\n",
    "- Discover **emergent behaviors** in embedding space that text can't access\n",
    "- Learn exactly **where and how embeddings influence** generation\n",
    "- **Make visible the invisible**—the assumptions and inscriptions built into these systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We've modified both the **SD 3.5** and **FLUX-Schnell** pipelines to accept raw embeddings directly, bypassing the text encoding step. Here's our workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate embeddings** from text prompts using T5-XXL, CLIP-L, and CLIP-G encoders\n",
    "2. **Save embeddings** as JSON files so we can inspect and modify the raw numbers\n",
    "3. **Vandalize embeddings** by scaling, inverting, mixing, or zeroing them\n",
    "4. **Inject damaged embeddings** directly into the diffusion pipeline\n",
    "5. **Observe the productive failures** and understand what they reveal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "By working directly with embeddings, we gain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transparency**: See exactly what numerical representations drive image generation\n",
    "- **Control**: Manipulate semantic space in ways impossible through text\n",
    "- **Understanding**: Learn how different encoders contribute and interact\n",
    "- **Creativity**: Discover novel visual territory outside the training distribution\n",
    "- **Critical Insight**: Expose the **technological inscription** (Latour)—the values, norms, and aesthetic preferences encoded into these systems\n",
    "\n",
    "When a system breaks down, it reveals its construction. By systematically damaging these pipelines, we make visible the **layers of inscription** that are normally hidden behind polished outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models We're Vandalizing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stable Diffusion 3.5**: Uses three text encoders (T5-XXL, CLIP-L, CLIP-G) with an MMDiT transformer architecture\n",
    "- **FLUX-Schnell**: Uses two text encoders (T5-XXL, CLIP-L) with a different architectural approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models follow a similar high-level pattern: **Text → Embeddings → Latent Diffusion → Image**, but they differ in how embeddings are processed and used. These differences become visible when we start breaking things."
